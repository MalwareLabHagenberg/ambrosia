Calculates the dimensions of the visualisation (for block events). The top level events are drawn using the
default block layout manager. Each event that has visible children creates a new block layout manager that
is used to position the children (the children's calcDimensions method is called). The block layout manager
that was used to position the children holds the width and height that is required to draw all children.
Afterwards (using this width/height) the parent event is drawn.
